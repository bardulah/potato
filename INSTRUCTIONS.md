# Instructions for Simulation Reality

This guide provides instructions on how to experience the Simulation Reality project.

## What It Is

This is not a traditional application or tool; it is an interactive, artistic 3D experience that you can explore in your web browser. It's a visual and philosophical journey through the ideas of simulation theory, consciousness, and the search for meaning.

The experience is designed to be immersive and thought-provoking.

## How to Use It

The experience is live and accessible at **[https://simulation-reality-hyohhmn7e-mtsalts-projects.vercel.app](https://simulation-reality-hyohhmn7e-mtsalts-projects.vercel.app)**.

There is nothing to install. Simply open the link in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) on a desktop or mobile device.

### Controls

The controls are simple and designed for exploration.

**Desktop:**
*   **Mouse Move:** Look around the 3D space.
*   **Mouse Click:** Create a "reality tear" or "glitch" effect.
*   **Mouse Wheel:** Zoom in and out.
*   **`Ctrl+D`:** Toggle the developer debug panel (for advanced users).

**Mobile:**
*   **Touch & Drag:** Look around the 3D space.
*   **Tap:** Create a "glitch" effect.
*   **Pinch:** Zoom in and out.

### The Experience

There is no "goal" in the traditional sense. Your journey will progress through different zones based on the choices you make.

1.  **Explore:** Move around and observe the visuals and the messages that appear.
2.  **Interact:** Click or tap on the screen to interact with the simulation.
3.  **Make Choices:** At certain points, you will be presented with choices. These choices will influence your path and the eventual outcome.
4.  **Reach an Ending:** Based on your choices, you will arrive at one of four different endings, each representing a different philosophical conclusion.

The best way to enjoy this project is to take your time, immerse yourself in the atmosphere, and reflect on the questions it poses.
